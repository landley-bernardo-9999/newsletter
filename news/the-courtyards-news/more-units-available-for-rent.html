                    <p>By the end of this January, The Courtyards(CY) Leasing Department expects more vacancy in units enrolled.
                        There are currently 16 units under their hands. The Occupancy rate (OR) is expect to become 68.75% from 93.75% by end of the month. 
                        According to the leasing officer of The Courtyards Georgina Yabes, the decrease in OR is normal. She explains that it is part of the leasing cycle where 
                        tenant has to move out at a certain time as part of the contract, it just so happen that multiple tenants will be moving out at the same time. She further assured 
                        that there's nothing to worry about.  
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Georgina is also the head of the marketing in CY and as part of their strategy to attract more tenants this year
                      she said that her team will double or even triple their effort to expand their online presence and improve more in customer service. 
                        She said that great customer service is means more customers. <i>"If tenants feel that they are valued they themselves will do the 
                         marketing for us. They will serve as the brand's ambassador through the word of mouth." </i>
